# MRSA_genematch
We use Python to identify corresponding genes across multiple MRSA strains and to generate detailed gene-to-gene maps relative to the reference strain used in the STRING database: Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus NCTC 8325. Gene information is extracted from NIH-sourced GenBank files and aligned both across strains and to their STRING counterparts. Gene matches are determined by comparing protein sequences and selecting the closest sequence alignment based on Levenshtein distance, with each match assigned a confidence score derived from the Levenshtein ratio.

The resulting Excel files list, for every gene, its identifier, its matched STRING entry, and the corresponding gene names across databases. The script findmatches_all.py extends this process by generating Excel files that map genes not only to the STRING reference strain but also to all other strains included in our analysis—ATCC_43300, USA100_N315, USA300_FPR3737, and VRSA1. These expanded maps additionally include descriptions of the encoded protein products to support clearer biological interpretation and comparison.
